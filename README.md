Bangalore Traffic Analysis Dashboard Report
1. Introduction
The Bangalore Traffic Analysis Dashboard is an interactive web application developed using Streamlit, Pandas, and Plotly for the analysis and visualization of traffic data collected from various areas in Bangalore. The dashboard aims to provide insights into key traffic metrics, such as traffic volume, average speed, congestion levels, environmental impact, and public transport usage. It offers a user-friendly interface with filters and visualizations to help users understand traffic patterns and make informed decisions.
2. Dashboard Features
The dashboard integrates several key features:
Data Filtering: Users can filter the data based on the Area Name and Date Range to view traffic statistics for specific areas and time periods.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Displays important metrics such as the average traffic volume, average speed, and congestion level.


Visualizations:


Traffic Volume by Area: A bar chart showing traffic volume across different areas of Bangalore, color-coded by congestion level.


Speed vs. Congestion Level: A scatter plot illustrating the relationship between average speed, congestion level, and traffic volume.


Environmental Impact: A pie chart representing the environmental impact by area.


Data Preview: A tabular view of the filtered dataset for users to inspect the raw data.


3. Functionality and Design
Data Filtering:
The sidebar contains two interactive elements:
A multiselect dropdown allows users to select one or more areas from the dataset.


A date range selector lets users filter data based on specific dates.


These filters dynamically update the charts and metrics based on the user's selections.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
The KPI section displays three key metrics:
Average Traffic Volume: The mean traffic volume for the selected area and date range.


Average Speed (km/h): The mean speed of vehicles in the selected region.


Average Congestion Level (%): The average congestion percentage for the selected area.


These KPIs offer quick insights into the traffic situation.
Visualizations:
Traffic Volume by Area: This bar chart provides a comparative view of the traffic volume in different areas, highlighting congestion levels with colors.


Speed vs. Congestion Level: The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between speed, congestion, and traffic volume, allowing for deeper insights into how congestion affects traffic flow.


Environmental Impact: A pie chart displays the distribution of environmental impact across different areas, helping users identify areas with higher pollution levels.


Data Preview:
The app provides a table that shows the filtered dataset for users to review. This data can be exported or analyzed further.
4. Technical Implementation
Data Handling: The app uses Pandas to load and manipulate the dataset, converting the 'Date' column to datetime format and filtering the data based on user input.


Plotting: Plotly Express is used for creating the visualizations. Plotly's interactive charts allow users to zoom, hover, and explore the data.


Streamlit Framework: The app is built using Streamlit, which simplifies the creation of web apps for data analysis. The app automatically updates visualizations and metrics based on user input without needing to refresh the page.


5. Interactivity
The dashboard's interactivity allows users to:
Select specific areas using the multiselect filter.


Define a date range to focus on a specific period.


View dynamic updates to charts and KPIs as filters are applied.


6. Aesthetics and Design
The design of the dashboard is clean and visually appealing. The following design principles were followed:
Clarity: The interface is straightforward, with labels and tooltips guiding users.


Aesthetics: The use of color in charts (e.g., for congestion levels) enhances readability and helps highlight key data points.


Functionality: Interactive elements like sliders and multi-select dropdowns ensure that users can easily explore and customize the data.


7. Data Storytelling
The dashboard not only presents raw data but also tells a story about traffic patterns and issues in Bangalore:
Congestion Issues: The bar charts and scatter plots emphasize how congestion levels vary by area and how they affect speed.


Environmental Impact: The pie chart on environmental impact sheds light on areas with higher pollution, prompting further investigation into possible solutions.


Traffic Management: The KPIs provide a quick overview of how traffic volume, speed, and congestion levels change over time and across regions, helping urban planners make data-driven decisions.


8. Limitations
Data Availability: The dashboard is limited by the quality and availability of the data. If the dataset is incomplete or outdated, it may lead to inaccurate insights.


Geographical Limitations: The analysis is based on traffic data for Bangalore, limiting its applicability to other regions.


Real-Time Data: The current version of the app uses static data. Incorporating real-time traffic data would further enhance its usefulness.


9. Conclusion
The Bangalore Traffic Analysis Dashboard serves as an insightful tool for understanding the traffic conditions in Bangalore. By offering dynamic filtering, visualizations, and key metrics, the app helps users quickly grasp complex traffic patterns and make informed decisions. Future improvements could include the integration of real-time data and enhanced interactivity.
